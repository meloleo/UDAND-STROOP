# Readme - Testing a Perceptual Phenomenon


## Introduction
This small project uses R to perform a descriptive statistical analysis of data on the Stroop Effect. The Stroop Effect demonstrates interference in reaction time. Simply stated:

```diff
+ Red
- Green
```

is more difficult to mentally process and verbally state than:

```diff
+ Green
- Red
```

## Installation
